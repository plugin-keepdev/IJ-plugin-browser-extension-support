This plugin for IntelliJ-based IDEs supports a new Browser Extension project generation and packing the source files of the extension to a .zip, .xpi, or .crx file suitable for importing to the browser.
The packed browser extension can be also uploaded to Google Chrome Web Store or Mozilla Add-Ons directory.
